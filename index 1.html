    <p><b>A blockchain</b> is a <mark>distributed ledger</mark> with growing list of <mark>records</mark> <i>(blocks)</i> that are securely linked toghter via cryptographic hashes. <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a <mark>timestamp</mark>, and transaction data (generally represented as a <mark>Merkle tree</mark>, where <mark>data nodes</mark>. are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare <mark>linked list</mark> data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a <mark>peer-to-peer (P2P)</mark> computer network for use as a public <mark>distributed ledger</mark>, where nodes collectively adhere to a <mark>consensus algorithm protocol</mark> to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since <mark>blockchain forks</mark> are possible, blockchains may be considered <mark>secure by design</mark> and exemplify a distributed computing system with high <mark>Byzantine fault tolerance</mark>.<sup>[5]</sup>></p>

    <p>Cryptographer <mark>David Chaum</mark> first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <mark>Stuart Haber</mark> and <mark>W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup></mark> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and <mark>Dave Bayer</mark> incorporated <mark>Merkle trees</mark> into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<mark><sup>[4][12]</sup></mark> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in <mark>The New York Times</mark> every week since 1995.<mark><sup>[13]</sup></mark></p>

    <p>A blockchain is a <mark>decentralized, distributed</mark>, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a <mark>peer-to-peer</mark> network and a distributed timestamping server. They are <mark>authenticated</mark> by <mark>mass collaboration</mark> powered by <mark>collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup></mark> Such a design facilitates <mark>robust workflow</mark> where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite <mark>reproducibility</mark> from a <mark>digital asset</mark>. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of <mark>double-spending</mark>. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain <mark>title rights</mark> because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels <matrk>offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></matrk></p>
